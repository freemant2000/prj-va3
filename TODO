update a word in a word bank
update or delete a sentence
when showing the summary of a sprint, should show the sentences used.
when deleting a sprint, no need to input the ID.
in a one-many relationship, show the index instead of ID?
merge worddefs
merge sentences

bugs:
marking and saving doesn't update the date for all the involved practices
if a word appears multiple times in a sprint, even if it is used in an exercise,
it won't show as such.
